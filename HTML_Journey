<h1>Hello World</h1>
<body> 

<title><b>Day 1</b></title>
    This is Blesson's proper beginning in web development.
    I have started a new course on Web Development - Free Code Camp. 
    it is focused mainly on website Creation using HTML. I will begin with that first.
    I will be spending minimum 15 minutes a day working on this platfrom. The first video i am 
    watching focuses on only HTML and has a duration of 2 hours. Looking forward to start work!
    I will be linking this file and my noting my journey on my Github account. Stay tuned for Day 2!

<title><b>Day 2</b></title>
    On day 2, I learnt about 2 things. Firstly, Charset and then Meta. Using these funtions is still
    a mystery to me but that is ok, I shall continue to learn daily. So now, I would like to make a 
    list of all the things I have learned to keep track of it and not forget.

    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Meta</li>
        <li>Charset</li>
        <li>
