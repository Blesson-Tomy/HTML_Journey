<h1>Hello World</h1>
<body> 
    This is Blesson's proper beginning in web development.
    I have started a new course on Web Development - Free Code Camp. 
    it is focused mainly on website Creation using HTML. I will begin with that first.
    I will be spending minimum 15 minutes a day working on this platfrom. The first video i am 
    watching focuses on only HTML and has a duration of 2 hours. Looking forward to start work!
    I will be linking this file and my noting my journey on my Github account. Stay tuned for Day 2!
